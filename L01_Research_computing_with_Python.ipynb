    "Python is a modern, fully-featured, general-purpose, high-level interpreted language, and supports multiple programming paradigms, e.g. object-oriented and functional programming.\n",

    "* Easy to learn and quick to program in - more time on scientific thinking, less time on programming. Note that our main work is research.\n",
    "* Dynamically-typed and automatic memory management - No need to define types for variables and functions. No need to manually allocate and deallocate memory for data arrays \n",
    "* Expressive - not only readable, but also concise "
